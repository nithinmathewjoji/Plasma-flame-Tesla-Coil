## How It Works

1. **Resonance**: The primary and secondary circuits are tuned to resonate at the same frequency.
2. **Magnetic Coupling**: The primary coil's magnetic field induces a high voltage in the secondary coil.
3. **High Voltage**: This high voltage ionizes the air, creating visible plasma discharges.

## Safety Precautions

- **Insulation**: Ensure all high-voltage components are properly insulated.
- **Grounding**: Proper grounding to prevent electrical hazards.
- **Distance**: Maintain a safe distance from the coil during operation.
- **Environment**: Operate in a controlled environment, free from flammable materials.

## Building Instructions

### Primary Circuit

1. **Power Supply**: Connect the high-voltage transformer to the primary coil and capacitor.
2. **Capacitor**: Ensure the capacitor is rated for high voltage.
3. **Spark Gap**: Set up the spark gap for periodic discharges.

### Secondary Circuit

1. **Secondary Coil**: Wind the secondary coil with many turns of thin wire.
2. **Top Load**: Attach the metal sphere or toroid to the top of the secondary coil.

### Assembly

1. **Positioning**: Ensure the primary and secondary coils are properly aligned.
2. **Connections**: Double-check all electrical connections.

## Usage

1. **Power On**: Gradually power on the Tesla coil.
2. **Observe**: Watch the plasma discharges and adjust settings for desired effects.
3. **Shut Down**: Safely power down the coil and discharge capacitors.
